			<p class="biography"><span class="dropcap">I</span> am from Snohomish, Washington where I was raised. I graduated from Snohomish High School in 2010 and Everett Community College in 2013 where I took a wide variety of courses ranging from sciences to web development to the basics of math and English. I currently live in Cheney, WA where I go to Eastern Washington University. I am planning to graduate with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Biology. 
			<br><br>
			I am a Community Advisor in the residence halls, currently as the Transfer Eastern Living Learning Community CA. <a href="http://access.ewu.edu/housing/reshalloverview/living-learning-communities">Learn more about LLC&#39;s here.</a> My future career plans are to go into Student Affairs with a focus in campus leadership or LGBT Issues.
			<br><br>
			I have travelled to many places around the world. Many of the states in the U.S., Mexico, Canada, even places in Europe such as Germany, Scotland, Italy, France, and The Netherlands. I would like to travel to New Zealand at some point because that is where my mom is from.
			<br><br>
			I am a huge animal lover. I have had many cats and small rodents. I currently have a cat and a chinchilla. My pets are my world and they mean so much to me. Everytime I see them, my day brightens.
